# Retrying IO

It's very common to encounter calculations in the wild that can fail for any
number or reasons. When making an HTTP call, for example, the operation could
fail due to:

* Server is down
* Client timeout exceeded
* Request gave incorrect data
* Returned data has missing/unexpected JSON fields
* A cable being unplugged

This is only a few of the countless ways in which things can go sideways. Any
time you're interacting with the world outside your program such as a network
or file system, failure *is* an option. In certains circumstance, like in an
HTTP request as described above, it may be worthwhile to retry the operation
and hope that things go better the next time. Because this situation is so
common, Ribs provides a retry mechanism for `IO` out of the box!

### Flaky Operations

Let's define our flaky operation so that we can see how Ribs allows us to
easily bake in retry capabilities:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={IORetrySnippet} section="flaky-op" />

It's not very important that you immediately understand every single bit of
what this code does, so long as you understand that it makes an HTTP request
to our fake endpoint and attempts to parse the response as a JSON string,
using the Ribs JSON library.

### Declarative Retries

Now that our flaky operation is defined let's apply the simplest `RetryPolicy`
to it that we can:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={IORetrySnippet} section="retry-simple" />

And just like that, we've enhanced our original `IO` to create a new `IO` that
will automatically retry the operation if it fails, up to 3 more times.
Recognize that this capability is available on ***any*** `IO<A>` type so it's
completely generic in terms of what the underlying operation is doing!

### Retrying Customization

The `IO.retrying` function provides additional ways to customize the retry
behavior of your operation. Here's an example:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={IORetrySnippet} section="custom-retry" />

Let's look at each argument to see what's available to you:

* **policy**: In this example, `RetryPolicy.contantDelay` is given, which will
continually retry a failed operation after a specified delay.
* **wasSuccessful**: Logic you can provide to inspect a successful compuation
and force another retry attempt.
* **isWorthRetrying**: Logic you can provide to inspect the `RuntimeException`
and determine if the opration should be retried again, overriding the policy.
* **onError**: A side effect that is run every time the underlying `IO`
encounters an error. In this case, the cumulative number or retries is
printed to stdout.
* **onFailure**: A side effect that is run every time the result from the
underlying `IO` fails the `wasSuccessful` predicate.

### Retry Policy Customization

You can also customize your retry policy to achieve the exact behavior you
want by using combinators and/or combining any number of policies in a few
different ways. To start off look at these examples:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Modifying Retry Policies" snippet={IORetrySnippet} section="custom-policy-1" />

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Composing Retry Policies" snippet={IORetrySnippet} section="custom-policy-2" />

There's virtually no limit to what you can do with `RetryPolicy` but to get a
full handle of what's possible, you should check out the API documentation.
