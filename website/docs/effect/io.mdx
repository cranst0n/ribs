# IO

`IO` is one of the most useful types in Ribs because it enables us to control
side effects and make it easier to write purely functional programs.

:::info
If you're familiar with the `IO` type from [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/),
then Ribs `IO` should look very similar. In fact, Ribs `IO` is a very close
port from Scala to Dart! The API is designed to stay as close as possible to
the original implementation.

IO

## Motivation

While Darts `Future` type has it's uses, it also suffers from issues that make
it unsuitable for functional programming. Consider the following code:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={IOSnippet} section="io-1" />

If you run this code, you should notice that the value of `x` and `y` are
always the same! Can you see why this is problematic? Now consider this piece
of code where we replace each reference to `fut` with the expression that `fut`
evaluated to:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={IOSnippet} section="io-2" />

When we do the substitution, the meaning of the program changes which leads us
to the conclusion that `Future` is not referentially transparent! That means
that it's insufficient for use in pure functions.

Here is where `IO` steps in. It provides lazy, pure capabilities that provide
greater control over execution and dealing with failure. Here's the same
program from above, using `IO` instead of `Future`.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={IOSnippet} section="io-3" />

You'll notice there are some differences in the APIs between `Future` and `IO`
but for the sake of this example, you can assume that `flatMap` is equivalent
to `then` and `IO.println` is equivalent to `print`. If you squint hard enough,
this `IO` version should look pretty similar to the original implementation
where we defined `rng` using `Future`. ***However***, this piece of code is
pure and referentially transparent because of the way `IO` is implemented!

Along with this small but important quality, `IO` provides the following
features:

* Asynchronous Execution
* Error Handling
* Safe Resource Handling
* Cancelation


## Asynchronous Execution

`IO` is able to describe both synchronous and asynchronous effects.

### IO.pure

`IO.pure` accepts a value. This means that there is no laziness or delaying
of effects. Any parameter is eagerly evaluated.

### IO.delay

`IO.delay` can be used for **synchronous** effects that can be evaluated
immediately once the `IO` itself is evaluated (within the context of the
IO run loop).

### IO.async

`IO.async` and `IO.async_` is used to describe **asynchronous** effects that require a
callback to be invoked to indicate completion and resume execution. Using `async`, we
can write a function that will convert a **lazy** `Future` into an `IO`.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IO.async_" snippet={IOSnippet} section="io-async-1" />

:::info
`IO` already has this conversion for `Future` included but the example
illustrates one case where `IO.async_` is useful.
:::

The only difference between `IO.async` and `IO.async_` is that with `IO.async`
you can include a cancelation finalizer. Since `Future` doesn't have a
mechanism for cancelation (at least at the time of this writing), we can safely
use `IO.async_`.

:::tip
To see an example of using `IO.async`, check out the implementation of `IO.fromCancelableOperation`.

## Error Handling

One of the first recommendations on the [Dart Error Handling page](https://dart.dev/language/error-handling)
demonstrates using `Exception`s paired with `try`/`catch`/`finally` to manage
errors in your programs. But it's alredy been established that throwing
exceptions is a side-effect! This rules out using them in our pure FP programs.

That begs the question on how we create and handle errors using `IO`.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Error Handling with IO" snippet={IOSnippet} section="error-handling-1" />

## Safe Resource Handling

Let's begin with a fairly typical resource pattern used in Dart program that
want's opens a file, writes some data and then wants to make sure the file
resource is closed:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Resource Safety try/catch/finally" snippet={IOSnippet} section="safe-resources-1" />

Now let's write an equivalent program using `IO`:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Resource Safety with IO" snippet={IOSnippet} section="safe-resources-2" />

This version using `IO` has all the resource safety guarentees of the `try`/`catch` version but
doesn't use `Exception`s to avoid side-effects.

## Conversions

`IO` comes with a few helper functions to convert common FP types into an `IO`.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IO Conversions" snippet={IOSnippet} section="conversions-1" />

* **IO.fromOption**: Takes an `Option` and will either return a pure
synchronous `IO` in the case of `Some` or raise an error in the case of `None`

* **IO.fromEither**: Returns a pure `IO` if the `Either` is `Right` or if
`Left`, will raise an error using the value of the `Left`.

* **IO.fromFuture**: Since `Future` is eagerly evaluated and memoized,
`fromFuture` takes a parameter of type `IO<Future>` to control the laziness
and ensure referential transparency.

:::caution
Simply using `IO` doesn't magically make the `Future` parameter referentially transparent!
You must still take care on controlling the evaluation of the `Future`.
:::

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IO.fromFuture" snippet={IOSnippet} section="conversions-bad-future" />

* **IO.fromCancelableOperation**: This behaves in the same way as
`IO.fromFuture` but is able to take advantage of some of the advanced features
of `CancelableOperation`.

## Cancelation

`IO` also allows you to build cancelable operations.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IO Cancel Example" snippet={IOSnippet} section="cancelation-1" />

This is obviously a contrived example but exhibits that you have a great deal
of power controlling the execution of an `IO`.

Also note that an `IO` can only be checked for cancelation at it's asynchronous
boundaries. Types of asynchronous boundaries include:

* `IO.sleep`
* `IO.cede` (or autoCede occurances)
* `IO.async`

## 'Unsafe' Operations

There are a few functions on `IO` prefixed with the word `unsafe`. These are
what you should be calling at the 'edge(s)' of your program. In a completely
pure program, you should only call an 'unsafe' function once, in the main
method after you've built and described your program using IO.

The reason these functions include the 'unsafe' keyword isn't because your
computer will explode when they're called. They're unsafe because they are
not pure functions and will interpret your `IO` and perform side effects.
'Unsafe' is included because you should always take care before deciding
to call these functions.

* **unsafeRunAsync**: As the name indicates, this will evaluate the `IO`
asynchronously, and the provided callback will be executed when it has
finished;

* **unsafeRunAndForget**: Same as `unsafeRunAsync` but no callback is provided.

* **unsafeRunFuture**: Evaluates the `IO` and returns a `Future` that will
complete with the value of the `IO` or any error that is encountered during
the evaluation.

* **unsafeRunFutureOutcome**: Returns a `Future` that will complete with
the `Outcome` of the `IO`, being one of 3 possible states:
  * The value itself (successful)
  * The error encountered (errored)
  * Marker indicating the `IO` was canceled before completing (canceled)
