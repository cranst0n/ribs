# Encoding and Decoding

Converting between your domain models and JSON is such a common task when
building useful programs, every language under the sun is saturated with
libraries that have their own flavor of filling the developer need. Each
undoubtedly comes with it's own set of pros and cons. Hopefully this page
will convince you that Ribs JSON brings enough utility to be considered
amongst other solutions in the Dart ecosystem.

## Decoder

For most cases, defining a `Codec` for your domain models is where you'll
find the most utility from the Ribs JSON library. However, it's worth knowing
how `Decoder` and `Encoder` work since `Codec` is essentially a composition of
those two types.

Let's quickly go through a quick scenario to introduce how the API works:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Domain Model" snippet={CodecsSnippet} section="codecs-1"/>

Now that we know what models we need to convert, it's time to create a few `Decoder`s for
each type:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Decoders" snippet={CodecsSnippet} section="codecs-2"/>

There's a bit to take in here so we can break it down into a few pieces an analyze them
one at a time:

The first `Decoder` we define is the `petTypeDecoder` which expects to find an
`int` and proceeds to `map` that to the value at `PetType.values[n]`.  *We'll
revisit this particular Decoder later since this implementation isn't entirely
correct.*

Next, the `petDecoder` uses the `Decoder.product3` function, which expects 3
`Decoders` that will each handle decoding one value, as well as a function that
will decide how those values are combined. In this case, we have:

* A decoder that expects to find a string value at the key `name`.
* A decoder that expects to find an *optional* double (or nullable) value at the
    key `weight`.
* The `petTypeDecoder` we already defined expects to find an int value at the key
    `type` which will then be `map`ped to a `PetType`.
* A function that declares the 3 values should be combined to create a new
    instance of `User`.

Since the input is valid in this small example, a new instance of `Right(User)`
is what we end up with.

## Error handling

Now let's revist the definition of our `petTypeDecoder` above. It has a fatal
flaw which we can address using the `Decoder` API. Consider the following
example:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Decoder Error" snippet={CodecsSnippet} section="codecs-3"/>

The last call to `Json.decode` throws an exception! This is because the integer
value (100) doesn't correspond to a valid `PetType` enum value. What is to be
done? The best first step is to consult the API to see what combinators are
availble on `Decoder` to handle such scenarios. Here's an improved solution:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Decoder.emap" snippet={CodecsSnippet} section="codecs-4"/>

`Decoder.emap` allows you to map a value but provide a function that return
an `Either<String, A>>` which allows you the developer to determine how
errors during decoding should be handled.

Finally, encoding and decoding `enum`s is so common that the API provides a
`Decoder`, `Encoder` and `Codec` specifically designed for them:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Decoder.enumeration" snippet={CodecsSnippet} section="codecs-enumeration"/>

:::tip
`Decoder.emap` only scratches the surface of how you can customize a Decoders
behavior. Browse the API to see what else is available!

## Encoder

Next in line is seeing how we can use the `Encoder` class to convert our domain
models into `Json`. The strategy is similar to the one we took with our decoders.
build one for each data type, and pies them together to build a more elaborate and
complex `Encoder`.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Model Encoders" snippet={CodecsSnippet} section="codecs-5"/>

## Codec

While what we've done so far is effective and composable, an argument can be made that
it's pretty verbose. We can cut down on that issue quite a bit by combining `Decoder`s
and `Encoder`s in form of a `Codec`!

:::info
Usually a `Codec` is what you'll want to use when writing your
(de)serialization code but sometimes you'll want or need a little more control
which is why it's still useful to be familiar with `Decoder` and `Encoder`.
:::

Let's use `Codec` to rewrite the previous `Decoder` and `Encoder`'s:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Model Codecs" snippet={CodecsSnippet} section="codecs-6"/>

This example uses the new form of `"string".as(Codec.integer)` which is just
syntax equivalent to what we used before in our `Encoder` definitions. The given
`Codec` is used to decode the value at the given key.
