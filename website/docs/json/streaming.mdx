# Streaming

Ribs JSON also comes with an `AsyncParser` that supports emitting JSON elements
as they arrive in situations like reading bytes from a file or a streaming HTTP
response.

## Unwrap Array

The first mode of streaming Ribs supports is `unwrapArray`, which expects the
streamed JSON to consist of a top level JSON array. The parser will then emit
events as each child element is completely received.

To illustrate, let's start with a basic setup with a couple domain models and
JSON codecs defined for each:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Models" snippet={StreamingSnippet} section="streaming-1"/>

Now consider that the incoming JSON, (whether it be from a file, a socket or
an HTTP response), will take on the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "2489651045",
        "type": "CreateEvent",
        "repo": {
            "id": 28688495,
            "name": "petroav/6.828",
            "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/petroav/6.828"
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "2489651051",
        "type": "PushEvent",
        "repo": {
            "id": 28671719,
            "name": "rspt/rspt-theme",
            "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rspt/rspt-theme"
        }
    },
    //
    //     Tens, hundreds, thousands of more events....
    //
    {
        "id": "2489651591",
        "type": "WatchEvent",
        "repo": {
            "id": 21289110,
            "name": "vinta/awesome-python",
            "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vinta/awesome-python"
        }
    }
]
```

We can emit each of these individual `Event`s using the `JsonTransformer`
in the Ribs Json library. Here's a simple example of how it's used:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Unwrap Array Transformer" snippet={StreamingSnippet} section="streaming-2"/>

## Value Stream

In the case the stream contains multiple top-level JSON elements, you'll want
to use `AsyncParserMode.valueStream` when creating your `JsonTransformer`.

Consider the incoming JSON will look something like this:

```json
["Name", "Session", "Score", "Completed"]
{"name": "Gilbert", "wins": [["straight", "7♣"], ["one pair", "10♥"]]}
["Gilbert", "2013", 24, true]
//
//    tens, hundreds, thousands of other JSON elements...
//
{"name": "Deloise", "wins": [["three of a kind", "5♣"]]}
["Deloise", "2012A", 19, true]
```

We'll creating our transformer in exactly the same way, but change the mode
the parser will operate as:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Value Stream Transformer" snippet={StreamingSnippet} section="streaming-3"/>

## Single Value

The last mode available expects a single top level JSON element and won't emit
the JSON event until it's entirely received. This effectively turns the
`JsonTransformer` into a standard synchronous parser but could still be useful
in some situations.
