# Creating JSON

It's also easy to create a typed JSON structure using Ribs using the `Json`
class:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="JSON Object" snippet={CreatingSnippet} section="creating-1"/>

By passing a list of `(String, Json)` elements to the `Json.obj` function, we now have a fully
typed `Json` object that we can interact with using the Ribs json API.

:::info
In many cases, you probably won't need to use the `Json` API itself. It's far
more common to define your domain models, and create encoders and decoders
for those. But it's still worthwhile knowing the `Json` type is what makes the
higher level APIs work.

What about serializing the JSON? That's also an easy task:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Serialzing Json to String" snippet={CreatingSnippet} section="creating-2"/>
