# Parsing JSON

If you've ever used the built in Dart SDK `jsonDecode` function, you'll know
that your JSON (de)serialization code becomes littered with the dreaded
`dynamic` type. Dynamic bring along with a lot of responsibility for the
developer to check what type of data exactly they're dealing with. Then you
also have to deal with the potential thrown exception, adding yet another
responsibility which could instead be encoded as a type.

By contrast Ribs uses it's own parser (heavily derived from Scala's jawn),
to build typed JSON data! No more type checks or casts using `is` or `as`
which pollute your code and reduce the readability.

Let's begin with a very simple example to get aquainted with the Ribs JSON
API:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Simple Parse" snippet={ParsingSnippet} section="parsing-1"/>

You can see that we can simply pass a string to the `Json.parse` function
and get our **value** back (emphasis on value because an exception will
*never* be raised!). With our value, it's easy to check if the parse succeeded
or failed from the provided JSON string. The developer will need to explicitly
handle a failure because the `Either` type dictates it!

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Handling Potentially Invalid JSON" snippet={ParsingSnippet} section="parsing-2"/>

Assuming that we've got a valid string to parse, as we do in this example,
what exactly is the `Json` type and what do we do with it? `Json` is a sealed
class that can be one of a few possible types:

* `JNull`
* `JBoolean`
* `JNumber`
* `JString`
* `JArray`
* `JObject`

These represent all the possible types of JSON as defined by the spec. To
confirm this, print out the result of parsing the string from above:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Typed JSON" snippet={ParsingSnippet} section="parsing-3"/>

You can see that each element of the top-level array has successfully been
parsed and has the proper type.

Naturally if we feed an invalid JSON string into the parser, we'll get an
error. For illustrative purposes:
