# Either

`Either` is type that represents the existence of one of two types. An instance
of `Either` is an instance of `Left` or `Right`.

## Motivation

While `Option` is a great weapon to have in our functional toolbelt, sometimes
it isn't enough. Sometimes it makes sense to provide additional information
when our functions don't follow the "happy path". For `Option`s, the happy
path can be considered returning `Some(...)` while the failure path would be
returning `None`. But consider the example below:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="User Creation using Option" snippet={EitherSnippet} section="create-user-1" />

Reading the code, we can see that a new user requires a non-empty name **and**
a non-empty alias. Let's see what happens when we try to create a few users:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={EitherSnippet} section="create-user-2" />

We can see that the function works as intended which is great but consider
the results returned in the failure case when the user's name and/or alias is
empty. They're all `None`. It would be much better if we could return a reason
why the user couldn't be created right? So let's do better using the `Either`
type:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="User Creation using Either" snippet={EitherSnippet} section="create-user-3" />

Much better! We can now see **why** the function was unable to create the user
in each instance. This would be great information to pass along to the user
to help them navigate our application.

:::info
We said earlier that the "happy" path for `Option` is `Some` vs. the failure
path of `None`. So what is the happy/failure paths for `Either`? Looking at
the previous examples, it should become clear that the happy path is `Right`
while the failure path is `Left`. This is by convention so you could choose
to ignore this, but be aware that many combinators in the Either API treat
the Right side as the happy path, leading to the statement that `Either` is
"right biased".

## Combinators

### map

Much like `Option` the `map` method on `Either` will apply a function to
the value, so long as the `Either` is an instance of `Right`:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={EitherSnippet} section="map-1" />

### flatMap

Chaining functions that return `Either` is simple using the `Either.flatMap`
function:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={EitherSnippet} section="flatMap-1" />

### fold

Lastly, when you want to create a summary value from the `Either` depending
on whether it's a `Left` or `Right`, the `fold` method makes it easy:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={EitherSnippet} section="fold-1" />

As specified in the `fold` function signature, each function provided
***must*** return a value of the same type.

Either has a lot of other useful combinators to make using them easy
and expressive! Check out the API to explore them.
