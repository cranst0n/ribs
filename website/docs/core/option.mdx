# Option

## Motivation

The `Option` type signifies the presence or absense of a value. In some
circumstances, a function won't be able to give a resulting value for every
input. These are called *partial functions* (as opposed to *total functions*)
since they are only defined for certain inputs. Let's have a look at an
example of a naively implemented partial function:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Our First Partial Function" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="naive" />

The intent is to find the maximum value in the provided `List<int>`. But what
happens if the list is empty? In this example the function will `throw`.
Exceptions are not an option when building purely functional programs.
They require that the context of caller be known at all times in order to
reason about what the ultimate value of the function will be.

Do we return 0? Do we return -99999? Either of
those result in an ambiguous result that the caller of the function will need
interpret. This violates one of the core tenets of functional programming:
**Local Reasoning**. The caller shouldn't need to interpret the value. The
**type** of the value should convey that on it's own!

So let's improve on the initial implementation of our function to use the
`Option` type:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="An Improvement" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="better" />

By changing the type that's returned, we've indicated to the user (and the compiler)
that this function may not be able to return a value. As a result, the
developer must account for either case.

Let's make this function even more readable. Here's a more elegant way to
define our `max` function even more concisely using the `Option` API:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Using Option API" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="better-yet" />

## Combinators

### map

You may ask yourself why we would ever want to use `Option` when Dart has
nullable types. And while nullable types are a great addition to the language,
they aren't as powerful and expressive as `Option`. On top of this, there are
still gaps in the nullable type system that make `Option<int>` preferable to
`int?`.

Let's take the following example and see how `Option` can make our code more
readable and composable.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Contrived Nullable Functions" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="combinators-1" />

We want to feed the output of the first function into the second function.
But using Dart's nullable types, this becomes verbose and more difficult to
decipher:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Composing Nullable Values" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="combinators-2" />

Compare that version with the null checking to this version using `Option`:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Composing Option Values" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="combinators-3" />

Now consider how this very small scenario would look like when you try to
compose the results from 3 functions together. Then 10 functions. The `Option`
API shines in these cases because functions compose. On top of this simple
excersice, `Option` has a number of additional combinators like `map`, `filter`
and others.

### flatMap

Another common scenario arises when you want to feed one functions `Option<A>`
into another functions parameter:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Composing Option Values" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="flatmap-1" />

This example shows how you can chain functions that use `Option` together to
create readable code. Achieving this level of expressiveness using nullable types
alone isn't possible.

### mapN

Our final scenario, but certainly not last you'll encounter in the wild arises
when you have a few `Option` values and want to combine them into something else.
Our starting point looks like this:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Combining Option Values - Naive" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="mapN-1" />

While this strategy works, you can certainly make the argument that it's not
particularly readable. Because this is such a common scenario, ribs includes a
`mapN` combinator that takes care of all the messy `flatMap` and `map`-ing
for you:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Combining Option Values - Naive" snippet={OptionSnippet} section="mapN-2" />

By creating a tuple of your `Option` values, you can then use `mapN` as a
shortcut to achieve what we're after. Note that the number of `Option`
values you're combining (arity) doesn't matter. Ribs will handle tuples up to
size 22!

:::tip
`mapN` isn't just used for combining `Option` values. You'll find it used
for other data types as well including `Either`, `IO` and many more!
