# Validated

The `Validated` type, like `Either` represents the existence of one of two
types. An instance of `Validated` is an instance of `Valid` or `Invalid`.

Additionaly `ValidatedNel<E, A>` is an alias of type `Validated<NonEmptyIList<E>, A>`
which describes either one or more errors (`NonEmptyIList<A>>`) or a successful
value (`A`).

:::info
This introduces a new datastructure used in Ribs, `NonEmptyIList`, which is a
list that contains at least one element. You can read more about it on the
[NonEmptyIList page](collections.mdx#nonemptyilist), but for the purposes of
`Validated` just understand it's a list with at least one element.

## Motivation

Let's expand and improve on the example from `Either` where we wanted to define
a function to create a new user from a set of inputs. Here's our domain model:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Our User Model" snippet={ValidatedSnippet} section="create-user-1" />

Remember that our function built on `Either` was capable of returning a reason
as to why the user couldn't be created (e.g. no name provided, too young, etc.).

But consider the case where there are **multiple** issues with the input. In our
previous implementation, once an error is encountered, that error is returned
and we can try again, only to run into yet another error. Frustrating to be
sure!

In this case `Validated` can help us by **accumuulating** all validation errors
in case of a failure or returning the validated user. Let's take a quick look
at what this could look like:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Utilizing ValidatedNel" snippet={ValidatedSnippet} section="create-user-2" />

With this definition, we can validate all the individual pieces of our user
data and if everything looks good, get our user! If one or more of the pieces
doesn't pass the check, we'll get information about ***everything*** that needs
fixed! Here's how it works in practice:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Validated Output" snippet={ValidatedSnippet} section="create-user-3" />

Once we run our user through the validation, we can decide what action(s) to
take. If the validation failed, we may show an error. If we succeed, maybe
store the user to a database.
