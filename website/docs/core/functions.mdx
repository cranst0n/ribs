# Functions

Shockingly, functions are one of the core elements of the functional
programming paradigm. Accordingly, Ribs provides some tools to work with
functions themselves.

## Aliases

Ribs uses a set of type aliases to make reading function signatures
(subjectively) easier. If you've spent any time working with Scala, these
aliases should look familiar:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Function-N Aliases" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="aliases-1" />

The `1` in `Function1` indicates that the function takes **one** parameter.
Predictably, the `2` in `Function2` indicates the function takes **two**
parameters. Aliases exist up to 22. One benefit of these aliases is that the
type naturally reads left to right so we can quickly see that a
`Function4<String, double, int, List<Foo>>` takes a `String`, `double` and `int`
and will return a value of type `List<Foo>`.

:::info
You don't have to use these aliases in your own code but they're worth familiarizing
yourself with since they're used throughout the Ribs API.

## Composition

Functions are one of the smallest building blocks of our programs. To create
useful programs though, we'll need to use many functions together. How do they
fit together though? That's a pretty general question but Ribs does provide a
few ways to help you along the way as you gradually combine your small functions
into something larger.

### andThen

It's often the case you'll want to feed the output of one function into another:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Simple andThen Example" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="andThen-1" />

While this example is a bit trivial, you'll likely come across instances on
your FP journey where chaining two function into a single value that you can
then pass around will result in a cleaner and more composable solution.

### compose

Using the same function definitions from above we can `compose` two functions:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Simple compose Example" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="compose-1" />

Examining the behavior of `andThen` and `compose` leads to the conclusion that
`f.compose(g)` is the same as `g.andThen(f)`.

## Currying

Ribs also provides functions to curry and uncurry functions. Currying is the
process of taking a function `f` that takes N parameters and turning it into a
function that takes one parameter and returns a partially applied version of
`f` that takes N-1 parameters. Check out this example:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Currying" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="currying-1" />

It's worth the time to work through implementing this function. But if you're
just looking for a quick answer:

<details>
    <summary>Curry Implementation</summary>
    <div>
        <CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="curryFn-impl" />
    </div>
</details>

Now that we know what currying is, we can use Ribs provided `curried` function
for `FunctionN` (where 0 < N < 23) like so:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Currying with Ribs" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="currying-2" />

This naturally begs the question: "Can you ***un***curry a function?". And
the answer is most definitely yes! Ribs provides this ability out of the box:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Uncurrying with Ribs" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="currying-3" />

## Tupled

One last, but very useful function that Ribs provides is the ability to convert
functions from accepts a set of individual arguments to one that accepts a tuple
of the same argument types:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Tupled Function" snippet={FunctionsSnippet} section="tupled-1" />

You may be asking why this would ever be useful but it becomes more apparent as
you start working with generic endcoders/decoders, data classes (which Dart doesn't
currently support) and tuple destructuring among other things. It's always
good to stick this one in your back pocket to pull out when the situation arises.
