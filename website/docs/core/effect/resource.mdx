# Resource

## Motivation

It's quite common to encounter a case where a developer will need to acquire
a limited resource (e.g. file, socket), use that resource in some way and then
properly release that resource. Failure to do so is an easy way to leak finite
resources.

`Resource` makes this common pattern easy to encode, without having to rely
on unwieldy and error prone `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks.

## Use Case

Here's a basic example of using `Resource` in the wild in relation to reading
a `File`:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={ResourceSnippet} section="file-example" />

We now have a `Resource` that will automatically handle opening and closing the
underlying resource (i.e. the `RandomAccessFile`) **regardless of whether the
operation we use the resource with succeeds, fails or is canceled**. This
naturally begs the question of how we are supposed to use the resource. For
this example, let's say we need to read the first 100 bytes of data from the
file:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={ResourceSnippet} section="file-example-use" />

### Combinators

:::tip
`Resource` comes with many of the same combinators at `IO` like `map`,
`flatMap`, etc.
:::

Because `Resource` comes with these combinators, composing and managing
multiple resources at one time become easy! When using `try`/`catch`/`finally`,
things can get messy at best, and incorrect at worst. But using `Resource`
it's possible to create readible, expressive code:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={ResourceSnippet} section="multiple-resources" />
