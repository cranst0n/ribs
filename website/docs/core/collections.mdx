# Collections

:::info
Ribs had it's own `IList` collection implementation but it was eventually
replaced with a version that uses <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections">Fast Immutable Collections</a>
under the hood for performance reasons. Ribs only has an `IList`, `IMap`,
and `ISet` to maintain control over the public API which did not originally
match the FIC API. Additionally, the API was designed to follow the Scala
`List`, `Map`, and `Set` APIs as much as possible, to ease development of
other Ribs libraries that were originally implemented in Scala.

**If you're interested in designing a fast and immutable collection in Dart,
Ribs is *not* the place to look! Check out the FIC library!**

:::tip
This page will only give a very short and incomplete example of each collection
type. It's highly recommended to explore the API for each collection type to
get a better sense of what capabilities each provides.
:::

## IList

An ordered collection of 0 or more elements of the same type.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IList Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="ilist" />

## NonEmptyIList

An ordered collection of **1 or more** elements of the same type. The API
generally follows that of `IList` with a few modifications since it's known
at compile time that it has at least one element.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="NonEmptyIList Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="nel" />

## IMap

A collection of Key-Value pairs. Values are typically accessed by providing
the associated key.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IMap Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="imap" />

## ISet

A collection of ***unique*** element of the same type. There are no duplicate
elements, as defined by each elements `==` method.
