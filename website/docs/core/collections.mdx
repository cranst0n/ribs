# Collections

Ribs provides it's own collection framework, **heavily** inspired by the Scala
standard collections library. It's primary aims are:

* Provide **immutable** variants of standard collection types
* Provide an **expressive and powerful** API
* Provide comparable performance to the standart Dart library collections

:::tip
This page will only give a very short and incomplete example of each collection
type. It's highly recommended to explore the API for each collection type to
get a better sense of what capabilities each provides.
:::

## IList

An linked-list, ordered collection of 0 or more elements of the same type.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IList Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="ilist" />

## IVector

An ordered collection of 0 or more elements of the same type. IVector uses
finger trees to achieve generally good, balanced performance across all
operations. This can make it a better option than `IList` for many operations
that linked lists don't do well with.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IVector Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="ivector" />

## IChain

An ordered collection of 0 or more elements of the same type. IChain provides constant
time `append`, `prepend` and `concat` operations which make it ideal for certain
circumstances.

## NonEmptyIList

An ordered collection of **1 or more** elements of the same type.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="NonEmptyIList Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="nel" />

## Range

Represents values in a range (inclusive or exclusive) between a start and end value, with a positive `step`
value used to calculate successive elements.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Range Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="range" />

## IMap

A collection of Key-Value pairs. Values are typically accessed by providing
the associated key.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="IMap Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="imap" />

## ISet

A collection of ***unique*** element of the same type. There are no duplicate
elements, as defined by each elements `==` method.

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="ISet Introduction" snippet={CollectionsSnippet} section="iset" />

## ListBuffer

A **mutable** ordered collection, analogous to IList.

## MMap

A **mutable** collection analogous to IMap.

## MSet

A **mutable** collection analogous to ISet.
