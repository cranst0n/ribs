# Overview

Ribs aims to provide useful libraries built on the core principles of
functional programming (FP). FP is based on a core idea that we should write
programs that only use **pure functions** that are **side-effect free** and follow
the rules of **referential transparency**.

Let's work through what each of those properties mean in practice:

## Side-Effects

To be brief, side effects are any action taken within a program other than
returning a result. Common examples of side effects include:

* Mutating a variable
    <CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={OverviewSnippet} section="overview-1"/>
* Printing to console
    <CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={OverviewSnippet} section="overview-2"/>
* Changing a field of an object
    <CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={OverviewSnippet} section="overview-3"/>
* Throwing an `Exception`
    <CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={OverviewSnippet} section="overview-4"/>

Eliminating side-effects from our programs allows us to write pure functions.

## Pure Functions

A pure function should take it's parameters, compute a result and return that
result. **It should do nothing else!** If a function has any effect on the overall
state of the program, it cannot be considered pure and violates a core
principle of FP.

One of the simplest examples of this below:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" snippet={OverviewSnippet} section="overview-5"/>

This simple function takes it's inputs and the result of the function is
entirely dependent on the input. Using pure functions allows us to use local
reasoning, in that we only need to understand what is happening in the function
itself, rather than needing to know any kind of context surrounding the
function call.

## Referential Transparency

A simplistic definition of referential transparency (RT) refers to a property
where any expression (E) can be safely replaced by the result of evaluating
that expression. Safely means that the replacing or substitution does not
change the result of the entire program.

Building on our definitions let's look at 2 examples that illustrate when RT
is satisfied and when it is violated:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Initial Program" snippet={OverviewSnippet} section="overview-6"/>

Now let's try substituting every occurance of `b` with the expression that `b`
evaluated to, namely `a.add()`:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Broken Referential Transparency" snippet={OverviewSnippet} section="overview-7"/>

After doing the substitution, we can see that RT is broken since the value of
`areEqual` changes. The ultimate reason behind this is that the `Counter.add`
function is not a pure function. It changes the mutable field `count` and then
returns itself, which is clearly a side effect.
