# Streaming

It's a common scenario to read and write bytes to and from file, socket or
some other `Stream`. Ribs provides the 2 basic tools to handle the machinery
necessary for these situations.

Let's assume we've got a simple type of model with our binary `Codec` already
defined:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="Domain Model" snippet={StreamingSnippet} section="streaming-1"/>

## StreamEncoder

Now image we generate these events on the fly and need to send them out a
socket after converting them to binary. `StreamEncoder` is the perfect
solution:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="StreamEncoder" snippet={StreamingSnippet} section="streaming-2"/>

We've built a capable yet expressive and readable program with minimal effort!

## StreamDecoder

Now we can imagine needing to write a program that will receive events off a
socket and do something meaningful with them:

<CodeSnippet language="dart" title="StreamEncoder" snippet={StreamingSnippet} section="streaming-3"/>

Using the Ribs Binary streaming API, it's easy to transform byte streams into
your domain objects.
