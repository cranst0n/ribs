These benchmarks should not be used as a definitive answer to which collections
are best. It's typical for different implementations to perform better for
specific use cases. You are strongly encouraged to verify any results.

Also bear in mind that these numbers are in **microseconds** so for many
real world applications, you're unlikely to see significant gains no matter
what implementation you use.
