### Alternatives

There are more battle tested libraries available that have overlapping
features, as well as additional features not found here, so you should
certainly consider using them. They all bring some things to the table
that you won't find here.

* [dartz](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz)
* [fpdart](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart)

There are also provided `compat` libraries to make it easier converting between
similar types in those libraries if you want to use both.
